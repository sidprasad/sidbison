Parser-generator systems specifications are generally large and hard to debug. Generated code often does not semantically match the programmers intent. Debugging machine-generated parsers is a non-trivial task, requiring knowledge of underlying implementations. This has led to the decline of bottom-up parser-generators as staples in language design and syntactic analysis workbenches.\\

Stepwise Interactive Debugger for Bison is a step-through debugger that preserves an abstraction boundary between Bison specifications and the underlying parser tables. It allows a user to debug a Bison 2.3 specification at the grammar level, requiring minimal knowledge of bottom-up parsing. The ultimate goal of this project is to make parser-generating tools more accessible to the average programmer.
