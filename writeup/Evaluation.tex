\chapter{Case Study : Usability}

\textbf{Note: This is a study proposal}\\

The ultimate goal of the \verb|sidBison| project is to make parser-generating tools more accessible to the average programmer. The proposed study will study the effectiveness of Stepwise Interactive Debugger for Bison as a tool that aids this accessibility. This will be achieved by studying its helpfulness in performing tasks with the Bison parser-generator. While ease of use and intuitiveness are very hard to quantify, user case studies are a good way to get a sense for the system's effectiveness.

The proposed  study will involve student volunteers from the Computer Science department at Tufts University. In addition to graduate students, undergraduate upperclassmen, especially those who are in or have taken Comp 181: Compilers and Comp 105: Programming Languages will also be approached to participate in the study via the online class forums. The only identifying information that will be collected will be the subject's level of familiarity with parser-generator systems.

Subjects will be provided with incorrect parser-generator specifications and inputs, and will be asked to debug these programs with and without \verb|sidBison|.  A questionnaire will then be administered, evaluating the intuitiveness and ease of use of the tool. 

The anonymous, statistical results of the survey will be included in the final thesis.
