\chapter{Additional Work}

The ultimate aim of this project is to make parser-generator systems more accessible. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \verb|sidBison| system could be expanded to deal with LL parser generator systems such as ANTLR. 
\item \verb|sidBison| could also be ported to \verb|YACC| implementations in languages such as C++, F \# and Standard ML.
\item Syntax highlighting and IDE support for Bison files could help improve the readability and debug-ability of grammar specifications.
\item Just-In-Time compiling within an IDE could help highlight potential conflicts in the specification while it is being written.

\end{enumerate}
