#Stepwise Interactive Debugger for Bison

sidBison is designed to be a step-through debugger for Bison 2.3 specifications at the grammar level. It is based on Satya Kiran Popuri's [iBison](www.cs.uic.edu/~spopuri/ibison.html) system. Further information can be found on the system wiki or in the sidBison [writeup](writeup/sidBisonWriteup.pdf).



sidBison was written for `Comp 197: Honors Thesis` at Tufts University under the supervision of Prof. Kathleen Fisher.
